# Assignment1: Break-out game
Based on the materials from the lecture, I customized the Breakout game.
I divided the blocks into five different colors.
If the ball hits a blue block, its velocity remains unchanged.
However, if the ball hits a red block, its velocity increases.
If the ball goes below the base object, it enters the trigger box and then disappears.
If you press the space bar, the ball reappears above the base object.
