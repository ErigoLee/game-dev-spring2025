# Game Development I
These are the projects I created during the Game Development I graduate course.


## Introduction of Projects
### (1) Breakout game
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933c9d59-90ca-48d0-a374-f9e30923641b" alt="image" width="600" height="372"/> </br>
1. Description </br>
- This project is a custom game based on the classic **Breakout** concept. </br>
- Players control a paddle using the arrow keys to bounce a ball and break walls. </br>

2. Gameplay Rules
- Players have **5 lives**. If the ball falls 5 times, the game is over.
- The game ends successfully once all walls are destroyed.

3. Levels
- The game consists of **3 levels**.
- Players can select and start from their desired level.
- Level 3 (Extension of Level 2)</br>
Level 3 reuses the basic structure of Level 2, but adds a control feature: pressing **W / A / S / D** changes the ball’s movement direction.

4. User Behavior Insight
- Some players preferred skipping Level 1 and jumping straight to Level 2.
- Based on this, Level 1 and Level 2 were separated and exposed via a selection screen.

5. Input Handling Fix (Debounce)
- Arrow keys were being registered as continuous inputs on the selection screen, which sometimes prevented choosing the intended level.
- A debounce interval (timeBetweenInputs) was introduced to prevent rapid repeats and ensure accurate level selection.

6. Code </br>
	(1) GameManager.cs </br>
 		- The following function is part of the **GameManager** code.  </br>
 		- It implements **page navigation** using the Up and Down arrow keys.  </br>
 		- To prevent continuous key inputs from being registered too quickly, an input delay is applied with the variable `timeBetweenInputs`. </br>
```csharp
void pageUpDown() {
    if (checkingTime == false) {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.UpArrow)) {
            page--;
            if (page > page_max)
                page = page_min;
            checkingTime = true;
            lastInputTime = 0.0f;  // Reset the timer whenever an input occurs
        }
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.DownArrow)) {
            page++;
            if (page < page_min)
                page = page_max;
            checkingTime = true;
            lastInputTime = 0.0f;  // Reset the timer whenever an input occurs
        }
    }
    else {
        if (lastInputTime >= timeBetweenInputs) {
            checkingTime = false;  // Allow input again after the delay time has passed
        }
        else {
            lastInputTime += Time.deltaTime;  // Increase elapsed time every frame
        }
    }
}
```
	(2) BallScript.cs</br>
 		- When the ball collides with a brick, its velocity changes based on the brick’s color.

- **Red** → `(-10, 20, 0)`
- **Orange** → `(9, -18, 0)`
- **Yellow** → `(-8, 16, 0)`
- **Green** → `(7, -14, 0)`
- **Blue (default)** → `(-6, 12, 0)`
```csharp
void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
{
    // Only react to bricks
    if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("brick"))
    {
        // Read the brick's color
        Color color = collision.gameObject
                               .GetComponent<Renderer>()
                               .material.color;

        // Change ball velocity based on brick color
        if (color == red)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(-10, 20, 0);
            print("red");
        }
        else if (color == orange)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(9, -18, 0);
            print("orange");
        }
        else if (color == yellow)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(-8, 16, 0);
            print("yellow");
        }
        else if (color == green)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(7, -14, 0);
            print("green");
        }
        else
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(-6, 12, 0);
            print("blue");
        }
    }
}
```

### (2) Simulator game
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f6e90cd-896c-4a3a-be74-5da2d0637e4b" alt="game screenshot" width="600" height="372"/></br>
1. Description - **Grid and Cell System** </br>
- When the game starts, the `GridManager4.cs` script generates a grid of **20 × 20 cells** (total **400 cells**) without overlap.  
- Each cell is randomly assigned one of the following attributes: **Water**, **Fire**, **Grass**, or **Road**.  
- After the grid is created, clicking on any cell with the mouse displays the cell’s information in the corresponding panel UI image.

2. Code

	(1) GridManager4.cs</br>
		- The nested loops place each cell at `(x * cellSpacing, 0, y * cellSpacing)`, creating a uniform **gridSize × gridSize** layout with consistent spacing in both X (columns) and Z (rows) directions.
		- On instantiation, each cell receives one of four materials — **Water**, **Fire**, **Grass**, **Road** — chosen **uniformly at random (25% each)** so that every playthrough yields a different grid composition.
  		- The cell’s **type** is determined by its material (e.g., Water, Fire, Grass, Road).
```csharp
for (int x = 0; x < gridSize; x++)
{
    for (int y = 0; y < gridSize; y++)
    {
        Vector3 position = new Vector3(x * cellSpacing, 0, y * cellSpacing);
        GameObject cell = Instantiate(cellPrefab, position, Quaternion.identity, transform);

        Cell cellScript = cell.AddComponent<Cell>();
        cellScript.SetTypeMaterials(waterMaterial, fireMaterial, grassMaterial, roadMaterial);

        // Apply either water or fire material randomly (for testing purposes)
        Material chosenMat = Random.value > 0.75f ? waterMaterial : Random.value > 0.5f ? fireMaterial :  Random.value > 0.25f ? grassMaterial : roadMaterial;
        cellScript.SetMaterial(chosenMat);

        cell.name = "Cell_" + x + "_" + y;
        cells[x, y] = cellScript;
    }
}
```
  	- When the player clicks with the mouse, a **raycast** is used to detect which cell was clicked.
  	- When the player clicks on a cell, the hit point is converted into grid coordinates (x, y).
  	- If the coordinates are valid, the corresponding **Cell** object is retrieved.
  	- The **panel text** is updated **only when a cell is clicked**, showing contextual information about that cell.</br>
		Example: - Clicking a **Water** cell displays:</br>
    	**“A calm and stable environment. Reduces fire risk and slows unit movement.”**

```csharp
if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
{
    Vector3 hitPoint = hit.point;
    Vector2Int gridCoord = new Vector2Int(Mathf.RoundToInt(hitPoint.x / cellSpacing), Mathf.RoundToInt(hitPoint.z / cellSpacing));

    if (gridCoord.x >= 0 && gridCoord.x < gridSize && gridCoord.y >= 0 && gridCoord.y < gridSize)
    {
        Cell clickedCell = cells[gridCoord.x, gridCoord.y];

        string type = clickedCell.GetCellTypeByMaterial();
        Debug.Log($"Clicked Cell Type: {type}");
        string explainStr = "";
        if(type == "Water")
        {
            explainStr = "A calm and stable environment. \nReduces fire risk and slows unit movement.";
        }
    }
}
```
### (3) People-1 game
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32c8ca67-5ff9-4c6e-a5c6-512890c23f5c" alt="game screenshot" width="400" height="372"/></br>

1. Description</br>
- This project was built using the **ADialogueSystem.unitypackage** provided by the professor.  
- All dialogue content was organized and stored in a **Google Sheet**:  
[Dialogue Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bxKhDvQU6dbHUVp_ThVrsOxNvDnRGg2cLrLTWeg6TVs/edit?gid=0#gid=0)  
- However, since the professor’s server has been shut down, the dialogue system can no longer be executed in its current form.  
- As a result, the project demonstrates the dialogue structure and data setup, but the live dialogue progression is unavailable.

2. Code </br>
(1) Dialogue Manager.cs </br>
	- The following code connects and retrieves the dialogue content from the Google Sheet.</br>
```csharp
if (useGoogleSheet) {
    // This will start the asyncronous calls to Google Sheets, and eventually
    // it will give a value to scc, and also call LoadInitialHistory().
    GoogleSheetSimpleConditionalConversation gs_ssc = gameObject.AddComponent<GoogleSheetSimpleConditionalConversation>();
    gs_ssc.googleSheetDocID = googleSheetDocID;
} else {
    scc = new SimpleConditionalConversation("data");
    LoadInitialSCCState();
}
```

  **Description of the Doctor dialogue within multiple dialogues**
   - Press **`D`** to advance the conversation with the Doctor.
   - Stops automatically when `countingTalkD` reaches `maxCountingTalkD` (`TalkingDoctorEnd()`).
   - On the first line (`countingTalkD == 0`), runs `SettingDefault()` to init UI.
   - Fetches the next line via `DialogueManager.scc.getSCCLine("C")`.
   - Alternates speakers each press:
    - **Even `countingTalkD`** → Man speaks (show **left** portrait, hide right).
    - **Odd `countingTalkD`** → Doctor speaks (show **right** portrait, hide left).
   - Updates `dialogueText` and increments `countingTalkD` every time.

```csharp
public void TalkingDoctorContinue(){
		
    //First dialogue
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.D)){
        if (countingTalkD >= maxCountingTalkD){
            TalkingDoctorEnd();
        }
        else{
            if(countingTalkD == 0){
            SettingDefault();
            }
            string line = DialogueManager.scc.getSCCLine("C");
            if(countingTalkD % 2 == 0){
                textObj.SetActive(true);
                left.SetActive(true);
                right.SetActive(false);
                //dialoguePanel.material = dialoguePanelImageLeft;
                Debug.Log("Man says: " + line);
                dialogueText.text = line;
                countingTalkD++;
            }
            else{
                textObj.SetActive(true);
                left.SetActive(false);
                right.SetActive(true);
                //dialoguePanel.material = dialoguePanelImageRight;
                Debug.Log("Doctor says: " + line);
                dialogueText.text = line;
                countingTalkD++;
            }
        }
			
    }

}
```
	(2) MainCharacterInteraction.cs</br>
   		- The system checks the distance between the player and each NPC.  
   		- If the player is within the defined **interaction distance**, the NPC becomes clickable.  
   		- When the player **clicks with the mouse** while inside this range, a raycast is fired from the main camera.  
   		- If the ray hits the correct NPC, the corresponding dialogue function (e.g., `DialogTalkPolice()`) is triggered.

This ensures that players can only start a conversation with an NPC when they are close enough and explicitly click on them.
```csharp
private void CheckDistance(Transform target, string targetName, int idx)
{
    if (target == null) return;

    float distance = Vector3.Distance(male.position, target.position);
    //Debug.Log($"{targetName} : {distance}");
    if (distance <= interactionDistance)
    {
         //Debug.Log("inside distance!");
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            Ray ray = mainCamera.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
            RaycastHit hit;

            if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
            {
                if (hit.transform == target)
                {
                    Debug.Log($"[SUCCESS] You clicked on {targetName} within {interactionDistance}m! (Actual Distance: {distance:F2})");
                        
                    switch(idx){
                        case 1:
                            gameManager.DialogTalkPolice();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
