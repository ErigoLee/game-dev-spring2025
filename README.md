1. Description
This project is a custom game based on the classic **Breakout** concept.  
Players control a paddle using the arrow keys to bounce a ball and break walls.

2. Gameplay Rules
- Players have **5 lives**. If the ball falls 5 times, the game is over.
- The game ends successfully once all walls are destroyed.

3. Levels
- The game consists of **3 levels**.
- Players can select and start from their desired level.
- Level 3 (Extension of Level 2)</br>
Level 3 reuses the basic structure of Level 2, but adds a control feature: pressing **W / A / S / D** changes the ball’s movement direction.

4. User Behavior Insight
- Some players preferred skipping Level 1 and jumping straight to Level 2.
- Based on this, Level 1 and Level 2 were separated and exposed via a selection screen.

5. Input Handling Fix (Debounce)
- Arrow keys were being registered as continuous inputs on the selection screen, which sometimes prevented choosing the intended level.
- A debounce interval (timeBetweenInputs) was introduced to prevent rapid repeats and ensure accurate level selection.

6. Code
(1) GameManager.cs
The following function is part of the **GameManager** code.  </br>
It implements **page navigation** using the Up and Down arrow keys.  </br>
To prevent continuous key inputs from being registered too quickly, an input delay is applied with the variable `timeBetweenInputs`. </br>
```csharp
void pageUpDown() {
    if (checkingTime == false) {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.UpArrow)) {
            page--;
            if (page > page_max)
                page = page_min;
            checkingTime = true;
            lastInputTime = 0.0f;  // Reset the timer whenever an input occurs
        }
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.DownArrow)) {
            page++;
            if (page < page_min)
                page = page_max;
            checkingTime = true;
            lastInputTime = 0.0f;  // Reset the timer whenever an input occurs
        }
    }
    else {
        if (lastInputTime >= timeBetweenInputs) {
            checkingTime = false;  // Allow input again after the delay time has passed
        }
        else {
            lastInputTime += Time.deltaTime;  // Increase elapsed time every frame
        }
    }
}
```
(2) BallScript.cs
When the ball collides with a brick, its velocity changes based on the brick’s color.

- **Red** → `(-10, 20, 0)`
- **Orange** → `(9, -18, 0)`
- **Yellow** → `(-8, 16, 0)`
- **Green** → `(7, -14, 0)`
- **Blue (default)** → `(-6, 12, 0)`
```csharp
void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
{
    // Only react to bricks
    if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("brick"))
    {
        // Read the brick's color
        Color color = collision.gameObject
                               .GetComponent<Renderer>()
                               .material.color;

        // Change ball velocity based on brick color
        if (color == red)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(-10, 20, 0);
            print("red");
        }
        else if (color == orange)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(9, -18, 0);
            print("orange");
        }
        else if (color == yellow)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(-8, 16, 0);
            print("yellow");
        }
        else if (color == green)
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(7, -14, 0);
            print("green");
        }
        else
        {
            rb.linearVelocity = new Vector3(-6, 12, 0);
            print("blue");
        }
    }
}
```
