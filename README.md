  Details are listed below.

### Images
Most of the images in the Pictures folder under each Prototype directory were generated by ChatGPT.
However, the player and NPC images in the platformer prototype were generated by ChatGPT based on existing asset images.
Please make sure to review the original asset licenses before using them.

### Fonts
- `LegacyRuntime`
This project uses Unity’s built-in runtime font (`LegacyRuntime.ttf`).
As of Unity 2022.2 and newer, the default built-in `Arial.ttf` reference was renamed to `LegacyRuntime.ttf`.
Please refer to the Unity license terms for usage.
