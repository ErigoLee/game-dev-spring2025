Movement on the ground:
In Super Mario, when the player moves to the right, they cannot go back to the left after reaching a certain point due to the side-scrolling mechanic. The movement feels smooth and responsive, with no noticeable acceleration or deceleration, even as the character's size changes with power-ups. The character can stop instantly upon releasing the movement key, without sliding or drifting.

Jump mechanics:
The jump skill in Super Mario is dynamic. When the player uses the jump, the character moves up and down in a fixed arc without the need for arrow keys. The jump height and direction are influenced by the timing of the jump. Additionally, the player can jump over obstacles, such as green pipes, and over gaps in the ground by pressing the arrow keys to control the jump's distance and trajectory.

Level design influenced by movement and jump mechanics:
The level design in Super Mario takes advantage of the smooth ground movement and dynamic jumping. Gaps are placed in such a way that the player must time their jumps carefully to avoid falling and losing a life. Obstacles like green pipes require the player to either avoid or jump over them. The side-scrolling mechanic ensures the player progresses through the levels, with gaps and platforms strategically placed to make use of the character's jumping abilities and create a balanced challenge.
