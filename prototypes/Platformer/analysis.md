## Super Mario

Movement on the ground:
In Super Mario, when the player moves to the right, they cannot go back to the left after reaching a certain point due to the side-scrolling mechanic. The movement feels smooth and responsive, with no noticeable acceleration or deceleration, even as the character's size changes with power-ups. The character can stop instantly upon releasing the movement key, without sliding or drifting.

Jump mechanics:
The jump skill in Super Mario is smooth. When the player uses the jump, the character moves up and down without the need for arrow keys. The jump height and direction are influenced by the timing of the jump. Additionally, the player can jump over obstacles, such as green pipes, and over gaps in the ground by pressing the arrow keys to control the jump's distance and path.

Level design influenced by movement and jump mechanics:
The level design in Super Mario takes advantage of the smooth ground movement and jumping. Due to this, I think that players may not have difficulty controlling the game. Gaps are placed in a way that the player must time their jumps carefully to avoid falling and losing a life. Obstacles like green pipes require the player to either avoid or jump over them. The side-scrolling mechanic ensures the player progresses through the levels, with gaps and platforms strategically placed to make use of the character's jumping abilities and create a balanced challenge. 


## Sonic

Movement on the ground:
In the game Sonic, unlike Mario, if the player moves too far to the right, they can still go back to the left. Without jumping, the player moves smoothly from left to right or right to left with no noticeable acceleration or deceleration. However, when using jump skills combined with movement, the character's movement exhibits acceleration.

Jump mechanics:
Unlike Mario, the jump skill in Sonic varies depending on the use of arrow keys. When the player jumps without using the arrow keys, the character's jump feels smooth. However, when the player jumps while using the arrow keys, the movement becomes much more dynamic. Because of this, I sometimes have difficulty controlling jumps, as I cannot keep up with the character's movements.

Level design influenced by movement and jump mechanics:
In the level design of Sonic, by combining the movement and dynamic jump skills, the character attacks enemies and gains rewards, such as a "ring," through this process. However, the player is able to attack enemies by simply combining movement and dynamic jump skills, without requiring specific abilities. Because of this, I have difficulty attacking them while playing the game.
