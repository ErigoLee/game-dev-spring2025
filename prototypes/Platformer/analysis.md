In the game of Super Mario, if the player moves to the right beyond a certain distance, the player cannot go back to the left. When the player moves from left to right, the player's movement feels smooth without noticeable acceleration, even if the player's size increases. Additionally, if there is a gap in the ground, the player falls into it without jumping and loses a life. When the player encounters obstacles such as green pipes, they must avoid them or jump over them.
