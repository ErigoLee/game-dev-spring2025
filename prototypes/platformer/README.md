## Platform-1

In this platform, I created the following mechanism. 

1. I implemented an arrow key mechanism.

   For example, the object moves forward when the player presses the 'W' key or the '⭡' button. It moves backward when the player presses the 'S' key or the '⭣' button. The object moves left when the player presses the 'A' key or the '⭠' button and right when the player presses the 'D' key or the '⭢' button.

2. I made a double jump mechanism. When the player presses the button twice, the object performs a double jump.

4. I made a mechanism to shoot bullets. When the player presses the 'X' key, a bullet is generated. However, it does not have any velocity, so it falls down.

In this platform-final, I created the following mechanisms:

1. I revised the bullet's velocity. When the player presses the 'X' key, a bullet is generated and gains increased speed.

2. I divided the game into a tutorial scene and a play scene.

3. In the play scene, the player has a limited number of bullets. However, when the player kills an enemy, a coin is generated. After that, the player gains 10 bullets.

4. After the player kills all enemies in the play scene, a key is generated, and the game ends.

5. When the player falls in the play scene, their health decreases by 10 each time. If health reaches 0, the game is over, and the game-over panel appears. When the player clicks the button, they are taken to the start scene.
